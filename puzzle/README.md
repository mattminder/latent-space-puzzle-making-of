# The Ghost of the Latent Space
For several years now, we have observed paranormal activities in the latent space. After years of research, we are still unable to explain so many things about deep learning - could that be because these things *cannot* be explained? We have come to suspect that the latent space is haunted - but we do not know by whom and why. 

This repository contains what we think are traces of the ghost's activities. Can you make sense of this?
